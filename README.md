# U-Net Feature Map Analysis
Investigating the role of feature map cropping in U-Net-based image segmentation. 
This repository provides code to understand how cropping affects the encoder path and overall segmentation outcomes.
It proivdes the U-Net's paper implementation which copies and crops the encoder feature map and adds them to the decoder path as skip connections.
It also provides an implementation that crops the feature map of the decoder path.
